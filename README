Pack version 2.0.1

Pack comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. This is free software, and you are
welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the license distributed with it.

Pack is a command-line tool that can combine a directory full of CSS or JavaScript
files, compress them, and then save the resulting files where you desire.
Pack uses Google Closure [http://code.google.com/closure/] to compress JavaScript.

Usage: pack path/to/pack.txt
  You may specify multiple pack files at once.

Pack works by reading a text file with instructions on how to compress or
combine JavaScript and CSS files.

Example pack.txt file:

  @combine css/style.css
    css/base.css
    css/layout.css
    css/other_stylesheets/*

This example will read in css/base.css and css/layout.css, combine the
contents of both files, and save them in a file called style.css. All paths
are relative to the directory of the pack file (you can specify absolute
paths if you need to). You can use "*" to specify all the files in a
specific directory, but don't worry--this will never accidentally read the
file you want to write to.

If you want to compress or minify your code, use @compress. Example:

  @compress js/javascript.js
    js/file1.js
    js/file2.js

The same thing works with CSS as well. You may add comments to the pack file
with the "#" character.

Here's a final pack file example:

  @compress css/style.min.css
    # Compress everything in this folder
    # into a file called "style.min.css"
    css/*
    # Note: this won't read style.min.css
    # even though it uses the asterisk!

  @combine js/javascript.js
    # Combine js files into one file
    js/jquery/jquery-1.3.2.min.js
    js/jquery/jquery-ui-1.7.2.min.js

    # Load all plugins
    js/plugins/*

    # Load everything else
    js/source/*

  @compress js/javascript.min.js
    js/javascript.js

Enjoy!
