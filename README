Pack comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. This is free software, and you are
welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the license distributed with it.

Pack is a command-line tool that can combine a directory full of CSS or JavaScript
files, compress them, and then save the resulting files where you desire.
Pack uses Google Closure [http://code.google.com/closure/] to compress JavaScript.

Usage: pack --css=path/to/directory --css-destination=path/style.css
  or   pack --js=path/to/directory --js-destination=path/javascript.js
Supply all arguments to compress and save JavaScript and CSS simultaneously!
  
Options
 --css                Directory containing CSS files and a load.txt file
 --css-destination    Where to save the resulting compressed CSS file
 --js                 Directory containing JavaScript files and a load.txt file
 --js-destination     Where to save the resulting compressed JavaScript file

When you specify a CSS or a JavaScript directory to load from, Pack will look
inside the directory for a load.txt file. This file should be a list of CSS
or JavaScript files to load, in whichever order you desire.

Example load.txt file:

  # jQuery files and plugins
  jquery/*
  plugins/*
  # Other files
  common/base.js
  common/widgets.js

This example will load everything in the jquery and plugins directory (in no
particular order), and continue to load base.js and widgets.js after that.
Obviously, you can comment with the # character, and use the * character to
load every file in a directory without specifying each file manually.

Pack is my first released command-line tool. I don't really know how to write
these things, so feel free to correct it as you see fit. Many thanks!
